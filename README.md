# ExpandRegion for Sublime Text

### Like "Expand Selection to Scope". But better!

ExpandRegion works a bit like the build in "Expand Selection to Scope", however it does not depend on Scopes (Scopes are used by ST to "understand" code, i.e. for syntax highlighting). Therefore selection expansion can be more granular and customizable.

It works similar to ExpandRegion for Emacs and "Structural Selection" (Control-W) in the JetBrains IDE's (i.e. IntelliJ IDEA).

## Prereleases

Pre-releases help us to test new features and improve the stability of releases. You can benefit the newest features and help us testing them. Just open *Preferences > Package Settings > Package Control > Settings - User* and insert at a reasonable (correct JSON syntax) position: 

``` js
    "install_prereleases": ["ExpandRegion"],
```

If you also use pre-releases of other packages just add them comma separated into the list.

### JavaScript (should also work for other c'ish languages like Java).

## Installing

**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install ExpandRegion is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

Once you install Package Control, restart ST and bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select ExpandRegion when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep ExpandRegion up to date with the latest version.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from [GitHub](https://github.com/aronwoost/sublime-expand-region) and copy the ExpandRegion folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    git clone https://github.com/aronwoost/sublime-expand-region.git ExpandRegion


The "Packages" directory is located at:

* OS X:

        ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/

* Linux:

        ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/

* Windows:

        %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/

## Using

- Set a shortcut.
  Open "Key Bindings - User" and add to following line: 
``` js
{ "keys": ["super+shift+space"], "command": "expand_region" },
{
  "keys": ["super+u"],
  "command": "expand_region",
  "args": {"undo": true},
  "context": [{ "key": "expand_region_soft_undo" }]
},
```
Note: third party plugins can not properly hook into the history. So soft-undo in basically only a undo expand selection. Soft-redo will not work.


## Develop

## Background

This plugin is inspired by the amazing [expand-region for Emacs](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el).

Here a video showing this feature (in Emacs):
